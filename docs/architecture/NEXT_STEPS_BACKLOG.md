# FolkIdle Next Steps Backlog

Status: living document. Numbered items are independent units of work;
number order is priority order within a category, not a strict dependency
chain unless stated. Remove an item when it ships; do not renumber the
remaining items (a gap is fine and preserves historical references in
commit messages/PRs).

## Client UI Hook Points

### 1. Region-Completion Codex UI (no client visualization exists)

The server fully implements per-region completion tracking
(`PlayerRegionCompletions` table, `TickStatePayload.CompletedAreaFlags`,
`RegionCompletionNotification` queue drained every tick, and
`CachedCodexDamageMultiplier`/yield multiplier bonuses that already affect
live combat math - see `GAME_DESIGN_SPEC.md` Section 1.3). There is no
client-side reference to `RegionCompletion` anywhere under
`client/Assets/Scripts/` - not in `UiCommandDispatcher.cs`, not in any UI
binder. The existing Monster Codex UI stack
(`UI/UiCodexListBinder.cs`, `UI/UiCodex3DViewer.cs`, `UI/UiCodexBonusBinder.cs`,
`UI/UiCodexListRow.cs`, `UI/MonsterCodexEntryView.cs`,
`Engine/CodexInventoryCache.cs`) is the concrete pattern to follow for a
new region-completion view: a cache component that mirrors
`CompletedAreaFlags` from the inbound `StateUpdatePacket`, a list/grid
binder, and a bonus-summary binder analogous to `UiCodexBonusBinder`.

### 2. Market Order-Book Browser UI (listings cannot currently be browsed)

`UI/UiCommandDispatcher.cs` already exposes `DispatchMarketListItem()` and
`DispatchMarketBuyItem()`, which send real `MarketListItem`/`MarketBuyItem`
packets - but both read their arguments from bare public fields
(`MarketTargetInstanceId`, `MarketListingPrice`) that nothing in the client
currently populates from user interaction. `UI/UiMarketDataBinder.cs` is a
read-only HUD (current gold, tax bracket, net-payout preview for a price the
player has already decided on) - it is not a listings browser. Needed: a
view that requests/displays active `MarketOrderRecords` for a chosen
`(BaseItemId, QualityTier)`, lets the player select a target order or a bag
item + price, and wires the selection into the dispatcher fields before
calling the existing `Dispatch*` methods. The server-side corridor and tax
logic (`GAME_DESIGN_SPEC.md` Section 3) does not need any changes to
support this - it is purely a client presentation gap.

## Architecture

### 3. Real horizontal-scaling design for SimulationEngine (do not do the literal "stateless PlayerSessionRegistry" ask)

A prior task asked to make `PlayerSessionRegistry` stateless via Redis to
unblock Kubernetes HPA. That specific class is not the blocker (see
`CURRENT_IMPLEMENTATION_STATE.md` Section 10) - the actual constraint is
that `SimulationEngine._activePlayers` holds every online player's full
live tick state in one process's memory, so a given player's session is
pinned to whichever pod accepted their WebSocket connection. Two real paths
forward, in order of implementation cost:

1. **Sticky routing / pod affinity**: keep the current in-memory
   architecture unchanged, add a Redis-backed `playerId -> podId` (or
   `playerId -> podAddress`) mapping written on connect, and route/proxy a
   reconnecting client back to the pod already holding their session (or
   reject and force a clean reconnect if that pod is gone). This does not
   allow arbitrary pod interception of an in-progress session but does
   allow HPA to add pods for new connections and drain old pods gracefully
   before termination.
2. **Full state externalization**: move `TickStatePayload` itself into
   Redis (or another shared store) with per-player distributed locking for
   the duration of a tick's mutation. This is a full rewrite of the tick
   loop's core execution model, touches every engine that currently takes
   a `ref TickStatePayload`, and should not be attempted without a
   dedicated design pass and load testing plan.

### 4. Market lock contention - partition before abandoning transactional integrity

A prior task asked to replace the order book's `Serializable` + `FOR UPDATE`
matching with Redis ZSETs and an async write-behind pipeline. Do not do
this as literally specified (see `CURRENT_IMPLEMENTATION_STATE.md`
Section 10 for why - it reverses this codebase's anti-double-spend
hardening for a real-money-adjacent subsystem). If matching throughput
becomes a measured, real bottleneck (not a hypothetical one), the lower-risk
next step is partitioning contention by `(BaseItemId, QualityTier)` - e.g.
per-partition advisory locks or per-partition worker affinity - so unrelated
items no longer serialize against each other, while keeping every
individual match inside a real ACID transaction. Only reach for
eventual-consistency/write-behind designs after partitioning is proven
insufficient, and only with an explicit reconciliation/crash-recovery plan.

### 5. Domain namespace reorg for Engine/ and Models/ (deferred, do incrementally)

`Engine/` (71 files) and `Models/` (57 files) are flat. A full mass
relocation into domain namespaces (`FolkIdle.Server.Core`,
`.Combat`, `.Economy`, `.Social`, `.Infrastructure`,
`.Utils.Cryptography`, plus a Models split between EF entities and
DTOs/seed routines) was requested and deferred this pass as too large a
diff for the value delivered right now. If picked back up, do it file group
by file group (e.g. move the market trio first: `MarketOrderBookEngine.cs`,
`MarketEscrowEngine.cs`, `CraftingEngine.cs` into `FolkIdle.Server.Economy`),
verifying `dotnet build` and the full test suite after each group, rather
than as one mass move.

## Cleanup

### 6. Remove or gate dead engine duplicates

- `Engine/SeasonEraEngine.cs`: orphaned duplicate of
  `Engine/SeasonalRotationEngine.cs` with a different, stale Legacy Shard
  formula. Confirm it is truly unreferenced, then delete it (do not merge
  it - `SeasonalRotationEngine` is the live, correct implementation).
- `Engine/PlayerChronoRegistry.cs` and the unused second
  `ChronoBufferEngine.ProcessLoginHandshake` overload: zero callers,
  candidates for deletion after a final reference check.

### 7. Fix ForgeSplicingEngine's dead BaseItemId parse

`Engine/ForgeSplicingEngine.cs` line ~165 does
`int.TryParse(targetItem.BaseItemId, out int baseId)`, but `BaseItemId` is
always a slug string (e.g. `gilded_sabatons_boots_armor_slot_base`), never
numeric, so this always fails and `regionTier` silently defaults to 1 for
every forge-fusion affix roll regardless of the item's actual region tier.
Fix: use `ContentRegistry.TryGetItemDefinitionByBaseId(targetItem.BaseItemId, out var definition)`
(added this pass for the market fallback-price feature, see
`GAME_DESIGN_SPEC.md` Section 3.1) to get the real `RegionTier` instead.
